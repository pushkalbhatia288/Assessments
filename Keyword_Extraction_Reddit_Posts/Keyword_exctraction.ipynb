There's no real trick to playing against them, apart from maybe finding out what's in HQ and R&amp;D through lots of accesses early in the game while it's still cheap. But the real trick is learning your opponent's tells so you know when it's a QPM, when it's a Beale, and when it's a Keegan.\\n\\nAt some point, however, you're going to have to stop playing his game, because his remote will be taxing enough to wreck you if you run it every turn. Hopefully, that's before the corp is at game point, because at that point you HAVE to check everything. But if you can set up and make enough money before that (not hard as Maxx), you can just put your Medium down and start hammering R&amp;D. At that point you'll probably just stop bothering with clearing tags and just run through his tagging ice. Assuming he's not already at 6 points and you score the final Quantum Predictive Kitty for him, you can win that way. Resistors (and Data Ward, if they have one) are the only ones that will get more taxing when you're tagged, but you could kill them with Parasite or cutlery before you go tag-me. Or Femme them, as others said.\\n\\nThe trick is knowing WHEN to go YOLO and start taking tags. Do you have enough money to make 3-4 Medium runs a turn until you win? Is he already holding a Beale in hand? Cause if he is, he could find a Psychographics and win in one. Is Exchange of Information a risk?

I can't guarantee your institution does a great job of this, but mine does pretty well.  The best advice I can give you is to just keep at the material, and practice a lot.  With introductory math courses like calculus, repetition of doing things like integrals and derivatives are important.  Maybe if you're in calc 2, looking at a lot of sequences, series, and practicing parametrizing curves over and over again would be helpful.\\n\\nIt seems like students just think their instructors magically understand the stuff.  It's quite the opposite.  For me, I had many classes, mostly in physics, that built up my knowledge on calculus and mathematical methods for problem solving.  Just for example, you will do roughly triple the integration in calc 3 just by the sheer fact that most problems require you to do triple integrals rather than single.\",\n",

I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny.

       " 'If, as your last paragraph suggests, by \"confrontation\" you mean \"a direct military confrontation\" as opposed to just \"any kind of confrontation\" (e.g., cyberwar, indirect proxy war, covert measure to meddle in internal politics, etc.), then the same things that could lead to \"a direct military confrontation\" are the things that would lead to any other kind of confrontation, for so long as Vladimir Putin remains in power.\\n\\nThe beginning and end of why Vladimir Putin acts the way he does is to preserve, protect, and expand the national and international powerbase he holds. That\\'s why he\\'s done the things he\\'s been doing to the Russian oil industry, as well as to that class of Russian oligarchs that once labored under the delusion that they were untouchable. Examples of this abound in recent memory: invasion of Georgia, invasion of East Ukraine, invasion and conquest of Crimea, etc.\\n\\nThe conditions under which Putin would provoke a military conflict are these: where the probability of success is sufficiently great, and the cost of that success is not unreasonably high. So, Putin will only engage in a military attack where it\\'s rational for him to do so. However, the costs of any success (however probable) have to be weighed against the costs of less intrusive means (namely, cyberwarfare -- especially espionage-- and information warfare). \\n\\nThough a controversial statement in some circles (for mostly political reasons, than rational ones), the United States and West more generally are currently engaged in a conflict with Russia. However, the battlefront for that conflict is in the minds of people, and the weapons of choice are ideas disseminated both directly and indirectly among the greater populations of United States and other European countries by Russian intelligence. This is mostly done through social media, the internet, and the like. By all counts, the Kremlin\\'s efforts have been tremendously successful. After all, Trump got elected. Brexit happened. Putin\\'s first loss was in France, when Le Pen failed to secure a victory. As long as those measures are effective at facilitating Putin\\'s interests, no military escalation will occur.\\n\\nHowever, a change of power in Washington might signal the end of those methods\\' efficacy. For example, if a political party were elected in Washington that took Russia\\'s political meddling in the United States\\' democracy seriously, then measures could be taken to retaliate either directly and proportionally (by doing the same thing inside Russia and in the sphere of Russia\\'s geopolitical influence, especially Ukraine), or indirectly (by harming Russia\\'s interests elsewhere, like sending NATO troops to train Ukrainian soldiers, and stacking troops on the borders of NATO countries). \\n\\nWhile it is hard to predict \"how\" Putin would initiate a military conflict, evidence (from Georgia and Ukraine) suggests it would be a Speznaz invasion under the dark of night by ununiformed soldiers of the Russian army, into a region where American troops were located. Putin would deny on the world stage that the troops were his, and would rather claim that they were \"eastern Ukrainian rebels\". The US State department, desiring to avoid war with Russia, might allow this to slip (if controlled by Republicans) though if the State department was feeling like it had a spine, they would retaliate in kind and pretend that they weren\\'t fighting Russian soldiers and only killing Ukrainian rebels. Whether Putin engaged in further military action in the first place would depend on what he thought the American and NATO response would be. \\n\\nAnother example, further on the spectrum of events which have a probability of leading to military conflict between the US and Russia, would exist in the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO. Regardless of the probable American response, Putin would attack Ukraine in that case because it would in his mind be worth the risk of war with NATO\\'s collective defense. After all, Ukraine joining NATO is probably the end of Putin\\'s power (due to the impact it would have on the Russian oil industry). \\n\\nA war between the US and Iran, or any military action the US could possibly take anywhere other than in Ukraine would not lead to a military conflict between the US and Russia, now that Syria is off the table. Syria well may have led to such a military conflict, but the prospect of that happening is very low now. Mike Pompeo and Tom Cotton do not have the power to start wars, either. Pompeo is too savvy for that, and Cotton is too dimwitted to stumble into that kind of power. \\n\\n ',\n",

       " '\"Baltimore Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in South Baltimore. On Wednesday night, two officers noticed a man acting suspiciously and showing characteristics of a person armed with a gun. The officers approached Allen Hosea Johnson Jr. and attempted to get the gun, but the Johnson fought back. During a struggle between the officers and Johnson, one round was fired from the gun and shot an officer in the palm of his hand. According to Commissioner Kevin Davis, the second officer used his stun gun, was able to handcuff Johnson, and retrieve the gun. The officer, a three year veteran of the police force, was taken to Shock Trauma for a non-life-threatening injury. Davis says the officer is in good spirits and will be fine. Johnson is in custody and was taken to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Johnson has been charged with Attempted First and Second Degree Murder, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, Felony Assault Second Degree of a Law Enforcement Officer, as well as other firearm and drug-related charges.\" ',\n",

       " '&gt;Yes, he was a movie actor and a lot of the martial arts shown are staged with pulled punches. Despite that, we know he has won real fights and also taught martial arts. This at the very least suggests he\\'s more than just a movie actor. Enough notable people have trained with him and vouched that he was the real deal that reducing him to just a movie actor is preposterous.\\n\\nLOL. The fact you\\'re trying to argue that the myths and legends of his \"supposed fights\" are enough to prove him as a great fighter is a joke when you try to dismiss the video showing Bruce Lee\\'s poor technique and punching fundamentals.\\n\\n&gt;We don\\'t know what that video shows, because we don\\'t know what he was trying to train. No context is given.\\n\\nWe do know what it is, we see Bruce Lee working that bag and having poor punching form and technique.\\n\\n&gt;And this is why you are framing everything as a boxing problem in a boxing context. This is what you know. Boxing has rules and within those boxing rules, everything you said probably holds true. You can win a fight without ever punching someone in the face. In fact, I have seen multiple in-person fights where people were truly going for the kill and they started and ended with kicks.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dI998TEspM\\n\\nWhat is this supposed to show? Bruce Lee fighting someone his size? Do I need to repeat how Mike Tyson in his prime was probably 80-100 lbs heavier than Bruce Lee, taller, longer limbs, and definitely more well versed and fighting than he ever was?\\n\\nThe fact you posted this video is absolutely ridiculous. I can tell you have never fought a real fight, nor have you probably seen what a heavyweight prime Mike Tyson does. It\\'s like, you seriously think that Bruce Lee would be able to stand right there and counter punch/kick a better counter puncher who could eat his shots and slip them simple enough? Lee couldn\\'t stop these guys from fighting back, and you really think he could do better against a bigger, faster, stronger, and better fighter?\\n\\n\\n&gt;In the end, we are talking about something completely hypothetical. My claim is that weight class is not the final deciding factor in a fight to the death, that Bruce Lee is trained in a wider variety of martial arts and that he would have an advantage against Mike Tyson in that situation. \\n\\nYour claim is wrong, and a joke. I\\'m telling you from someone who has ring experience and recognizes what power is vs. bigger and smaller fighters. You go to any professional fighter/trainer well versed with fighting at any MMA or Boxing gym, and they will straight up laugh in your face when you claim Bruce Lee has an advantage against Mike Tyson in any fight scenario involving them face to face without anything but their fists.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re probably one of those people who seriously thinks Bruce Lee would land the first punch/kick several times, all quicker than Tyson\\'s first (LOL).\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you have no video evidence, nothing to show me Lee can stand up to this:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBDsfGTQpdc\\n\\n\\nOh, and these are all men 6\\'0\" / 210 lbs+ in fighting shape.\\n\\nLast but not least, on one of his, \"legendary fights\":\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee\\'s associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T\\'ai chi ch\\'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.[42] Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight from the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong\\'s traditional handshake offer by \"pretending to extend a friendly hand only to suddenly transform the hand into a four-pronged spear aimed at Wong\\'s eyes\". Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee\\'s \"unusually winded\" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.[42] According to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell\\'s account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said \\'do you give up?\\' and the man said he gave up\".[41]\\nA couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.[42] In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation \"despite his reputation for responding with fists of fury to the slightest provocation\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you know what? If you still want to argue, go post on r/mma and ask them what they think. They should be unbiased/favor Bruce Lee, right? Let me know how many people you can find actually agree with you when you get laughed at. Maybe they\\'ll be able to educate you better on this manner, since I\\'m kind of being an ass about this (and I do apologize on that regard). I\\'m sorry to crush your childhood dreams, but Bruce lee was a movie actor first and foremost. Not a fighter. He could have been a great fighter, in a lower weight class in MMA or Boxing, but he was never beating Mike Tyson at his best.',\n",

       " \"Read a book called The Millionaire Mind that surveyed millionaires, asking questions like this, among others. Rich doctors and lawyers emphasized grades/GPA more than other fields, unsurprisingly. Most millionaires did not inherit their wealth, most were college graduates, and their GPA on average was 2.9\\n\\n&gt;Some of the myths about these people are that they were all straight A students, scored at the top on the SAT, attended elite private schools, etc.  The average SAT score for the sample was 1190.  Their most frequent grade in both high school and college was “B.”  Their GPA in college was 2.9.  They typically did not qualify for admission to an “elite” college or university.  But there were a few who, in spite of their mediocre credentials, somehow made it into the freshman class of a prestigious college.\\n\\nhttp://www.thomasjstanley.com/2012/12/college-ranking-not-among-millionaires-key-success-factors/\\n\\nWhat I noticed though is that they often severely downplay the role of luck, and like to attribute their success more often to other factors like being well disciplined or having a strong marriage.

       " \"Yes, you're right, drugs don't teach you anything that's not already there. Living a life without drugs is Noble and superior, no doubt. However, since these kinds of drugs do amplify certain awarenesses that do lead to self growth, it becomes another possible road for you to learn from.\\n\\nPsychedelics just help you analyze reality because awareness becomes heightened, so issues become priority #1. You can't distract yourself on them. If you do something you know is not ok, e.g. playing a video game while you have homework to do, you will be hyper aware of how you are just distracting yourself and all that comes along with that choice. Not everybody is cognizant of their selves, there's a lot of people who choose to live a life of distraction from reality, it can be how they were raised i.e. the way their environment shaped them, or just... Unawareness. Not everyone has people to show them the way, but once you're tripping, your emotions become amplified and negative things become a HUGE event, so if you're doing something negative, that becomes an issue and you feel a massive need to fix it.\\n\\nYou also receive a heightened sense of empathy, it changes the way you see people and makes you want to spread love and happiness to everybody, you can see right through everything. Even beautiful people are so sad. Body language becomes very obvious. Jealousy and negative beliefs related to beauty leave you.\\n\\nIt's only a perspective shift, but it definitely makes you very sensitive to your environment, which is good if you want to use it therapeutically.\\n\\nI'd recommend therapy first. But I can definitely see how using shrooms while in a therapy session can boost your ability to navigate yourself because of the way it makes you. I want to try that some day.\",\n",
